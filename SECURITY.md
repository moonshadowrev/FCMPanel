## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Deployment Security
- **Always use HTTPS** in production environments
- **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
- **Use strong passwords** for admin accounts
- **Enable rate limiting** and monitoring
- **Restrict network access** to necessary ports only

#### Configuration Security
```bash
# Use strong, unique secrets
SESSION_SECRET=64-character-random-string
JWT_SECRET=64-character-random-string
ENCRYPTION_KEY=32-character-random-string

# Enable security headers
NODE_ENV=production
TRUST_PROXY=true

# Restrict CORS origins
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
```

#### Firebase Security
- **Use service accounts** with minimal required permissions
- **Rotate service account keys** regularly
- **Monitor Firebase usage** for unusual activity
- **Enable Firebase security rules** appropriately

### For Developers

#### Secure Development
- **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Output encoding**: Encode all outputs properly
- **Parameterized queries**: Use ORM/prepared statements
- **Authentication checks**: Verify authentication on all endpoints
- **Authorization checks**: Implement proper access controls

#### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] All inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Authentication is required where needed
- [ ] Authorization checks are implemented
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Security headers are properly configured

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiration
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, User, Viewer)
- Password hashing using bcrypt with salt
- Session management with secure cookies
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

#### Data Protection
- AES-256-GCM encryption for Firebase credentials
- HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Input validation using express-validator
- CSRF protection on form submissions
- SQL injection prevention via Sequelize ORM

#### Infrastructure Security
- Security headers via Helmet.js
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- File upload restrictions and validation
- Error handling that doesn't leak information

### Areas of Ongoing Improvement

#### Planned Security Enhancements
- [ ] Enhanced audit logging and monitoring
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA) support
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 integration
- [ ] Advanced rate limiting with IP whitelisting
- [ ] Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

#### Known Limitations
- **Single-factor authentication**: Currently only password-based
- **Limited audit trail**: Basic logging without advanced analytics
- **Session storage**: SQLite-based session storage (consider Redis for scale)
- **File upload**: Basic file validation (consider advanced scanning)

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Logging and Monitoring

We log security-relevant events including:
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Authorization failures
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Configuration changes
- System errors and exceptions

### Recommended Monitoring

For production deployments, we recommend:

#### System Monitoring
- **Failed login attempts**: Alert on multiple failures
- **API abuse**: Monitor for unusual request patterns
- **Error rates**: Track application and security errors
- **Resource usage**: Monitor for DoS indicators

#### Security Tools
```bash
# Dependency scanning
npm audit
snyk test

# Security linting
npm install -g eslint-plugin-security
eslint --ext .js .

# Container scanning (if using Docker)
docker scout cves
```
